# Hi, good people! :metal:

:books: I'm a Front-End developer and student, and I'm always looking for knowledge.

:earth_americas: Carioca in love with the TI area! I love to program, innovate, and share knowledge.

:computer: Being a developer is a journey where the next stop is the solution to a problem.


  :thought_balloon: “Try once, twice, three times and if possible try the fourth, fifth and as many times as necessary. Just     don't give up in the first few attempts, persistence is a friend of conquest. If you want to get where the majority does not go, do what the majority does not do.”
